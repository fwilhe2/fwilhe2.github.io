# Florian Wilhelm's Blog

I'm a software developer working at SAP and living in [Potsdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam).

This blog is a place for my personal thoughts.
They don't reflect the views of my employer.

I'm quite active [on twitter](https://twitter.com/fwilhe).
My [personal GitHub Profile is here](https://github.com/fwilhe2/).
